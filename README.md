## Description

This site is intended as an initial point of call for people looking for information on mental health issues, including a description of common issues and tips on how to recognise them. 

The site has a header with hero image as an introduction to the page. Further sections at time of writing are a list of potential signs of poor mental health, brief descriptions of some common mental health issues, and a resources section with links to point the user to further reading and support.

A possible future feature is a section on self-help and ways to mitigate stress.
